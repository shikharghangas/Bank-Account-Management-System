Project Name:
Bank Account Management System

Description:
The Bank Account Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage bank accounts and perform various operations such as adding, viewing, modifying, and deleting accounts. The application also provides a summary of accounts and other functionalities. The system interacts with users through the console, enabling them to input commands and receive information and prompts dynamically.

Key Features:
